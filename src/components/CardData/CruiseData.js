Just make sure you set aside a few days before your sailing to really get to know the best of Singapore while you’re there. This vibrant island-state is a true cultural hub. It boasts four official languages and is home to a community that represents countries around the world. If you want to stretch your legs, climb to the summit of Mount Faber. At just over 300 feet, it’s more of a hill than a mountain, but it offers pretty panoramic views of the skyline and bay. Or spend some time exploring the impressive Orchid Garden and Botanic Garden, where you’ll find 250 different types of ginger growing. It’s the perfect lead-up to a meal of Singapore’s world-famous street food, like sweet and buttery kaya toast, flaky roti prata (sometimes called the “Asian croissant”), and tender Hainanese chicken rice, considered by many to be Singapore’s national dish.",
